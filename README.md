Women's Health Survey

In 1985, the USDA commissioned a study of women’s nutrition. Nutrient intake was measured for a random sample of 737 women aged 25-50 years. The following variables were measured:

- Calcium(mg)
- Iron(mg)
- Protein(g)
- Vitamin A(μg)
- Vitamin C(mg)
- Descriptive Analysis

We are going to analyse the dataset on the basis of descriptive analysis functions that will help us in understanding the pattern and behaviour of the data.
